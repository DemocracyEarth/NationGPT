# Contributing to the Country Legal Documents Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Country Legal Documents Repository! This project aims to maintain a comprehensive and accessible collection of Nation-Sates' constitution, national laws, and provincial regulations. Contributions from legal professionals, scholars, and the public are invaluable to achieving this goal.

## How to Contribute

Contributions can take several forms, from adding new documents, updating existing ones, correcting errors, or improving the repository's organization. Here's how you can get started:

### Reporting Issues

- **Found a Mistake?** If you spot errors or outdated information in any document, please report it by [creating an issue](link-to-issues-page). Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand the problem.

### Document Additions or Updates

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your account.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Make a new branch in your forked repository for your changes.
3. **Add or Update Documents**: Follow the repository's naming and formatting conventions to add or update documents. Ensure all legal texts are accurate and sourced appropriately.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages to summarize your changes.
5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Open a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Provide a comprehensive description of your changes and any additional context (e.g., references to legal texts or amendments).

### Guidelines for Document Formatting

- **Plain Text Format**: Submit documents in plain text format (.txt) for consistency and accessibility.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use lowercase for all directory and file names, separating words with underscores for readability.
- **Language**: Ensure documents are submitted in [the primary language used in the repository], and provide an English translation if possible for broader accessibility.

### Review Process

All submissions will undergo a review process by repository maintainers. We aim to review contributions promptly, but the process may take some time depending on the complexity of the changes. During the review, we may request further information or modifications. Once approved, contributions will be merged into the repository.

## Code of Conduct

Contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](link-to-code-of-conduct). Respectful and constructive dialogue is paramount to maintaining an inclusive and supportive community.

## Questions?

If you have questions about the contribution process, feel free to [open an issue for discussion](link-to-issues-page) or contact the repository maintainers directly at [contact information].
